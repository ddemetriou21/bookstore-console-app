# bookstore-console-app

playing around with creating a bookstore console app 
that reads the dummy data from the json file I've created.
handles user login, allows users to view bookstore as a guest
but limits the capability of what they can do (i.e cant checkout as a guest
instead they are redirected to creating an account before checking out.)

allows the user to be able to search books based on title/author and ISBN number
allows user to add books into a 'basket' and checking out.
stores information of past deliveries of the user.
